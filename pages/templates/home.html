    <h5 class="text-muted">A web application to aid in understanding of asymptotic complexity theory.</h5>
    <p>
        The navbar will redirect you to the tools to provide asymptotic analysis of a given equation.
        Just follow the instructions given on the page, and be sure that all input is in python's math format.
        I hope this proves to be a helpful learning aid!

    Intelligo is my undergraduate honours project, completed winter 2019.
    This project was intended to help those in COMP 3804 at Carleton University, in learning the basics of complexity theory.
    <br>
    Developed in chrome.
    <br>
    The web framework behind this application is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>.
    <br>
    The logic layer of this application was written in python3.7
    <br>
    The libraries I used with this are <a href="https://sympy.org/" target="_blank">SymPy</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/anytree/" target="_blank">Anytree</a>, and <a href="https://graphviz.org/" target="_blank">graphviz</a>.
